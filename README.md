# Cinesent: Review2Rating

Cinesent is a deep learning-based project designed to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews and convert them into a rating score. This project uses Sequential Neural Networks (SNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. After thorough testing, LSTM was found to provide the best accuracy.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze movie reviews to determine their sentiment.
- **Rating Prediction**: Convert the sentiment into a rating score.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes SNN, CNN, and LSTM models for accurate predictions.
- **IMDB Dataset**: The model is trained using the IMDB dataset.
